NAME
     fold - wrap each input line to fit in specified width

SYNOPSIS
     fold [-bs] [-w width] [--bytes] [--spaces] [--width=width] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version  of  fold.   fold  prints  the
     specified  files,  or  the  standard input when no files are given or the
     filename `-' is encountered, on the  standard  output.   It  breaks  long
     lines  into  multiple  shorter lines by inserting a newline at column 80.
     It counts screen columns, so tab characters usually take  more  than  one
     column,  backspace  characters  decrease  the  column count, and carriage
     return characters set the column count back to zero.

     OPTIONS

     -b, --bytes
          Count bytes rather than  columns,  so  that  tabs,  backspaces,  and
          carriage returns are each counted as taking up one column, just like
          other characters.

     -s, --spaces
          Break at word boundaries.  If the line contains any blanks, the line
          is  broken  after  the last blank that falls within the maximum line
          length.  If there are no blanks, the line is broken at  the  maximum
          line length, as usual.

     -w, --width width
          Use a maximum line length of width columns instead of 80.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well  as  `--',  for
     compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually support for `+' will be
     removed, because it is incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
