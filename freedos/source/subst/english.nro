.SH DESCRIPTION
.cu
swsubst
is designed to manipulate the CDS (
.cb
.ct C
.ct urrent
.cb
D
.ct irectory 
.cb
S
.ct tructure), nearly any information within the CDS
is accessable. By renaming or by copying of the executable
.cb
swsubst.exe
to one of the above mentioned file names one command
switch is automatically inserted right after the executable's name, e.g.
"query /a c:+net" is equal to "swsubst /q /a c:+net". Only 
.cu
join
and 
.cu
subst
have an additional meaning by restricting 
.cu
swsubst
to conform to the DOS standard tools with the same name.

Unnecessary options, or options which has no meaning with the invoked
command, are scanned and ignored.

A path specification can be logical or physical. The drive specification
of a physical drive means that drive, which got that letter while
booting. The logical drive specfication is the one typed on the command
line, e.g.  after the command "SUBST C: E:\FREEDOS", the logical drive
specification "C:" is the physical "E:", that means, if the DOS Prompt
says: "C:\>", that is the "original" directory "E:\FREEDOS". The
"original" drive "C" is no longer available.

In order to remove that limitation a leading dash '-' indicates a physical
path. So after "SUBST D: C:\SOURCE" the logical drive "D:" will point into
"E:\FREEDOS\SOURCE", whereas after "SWSUBST D: -C:\SOURCE" drive "D:"
points into "C:\SOURCE". 
.cu
Note:
If a physical path is not fully
qualified, it will be qualifed according to the logical current working
directory. 

Drive specifications are also enhanced:
.br
Where only a drive specification is expected, a single letter acts a
drive letter as well as a full-qualified path.
.br
Besides these methods, it is possible to specify a drive specification
by the name of its driver or its volume label. Driver names are
specified with ":*:", where "*" stands for the up to eight characters
long name. Because one driver may handle several drives, a number can be
specified, like ":#:*:", where "#" stands for the zero-based number and
"*" for the driver name. 
.cu
Note:
Not all drivers have a name.
.br
The search for a volume label is activated by using "::*:" or ":-:*:", where
"*" stands for the volume label and the optional dash '-' causes to
temporarily release SUBST and JOIN relations.
.br
While scanning, the drives are searched in the order: A:, B:, ...
If one drive does not respond, it is ignored.
.br
The names are case-insensitive and are matched, that the characters
specified with "*" must lead the name, e.g.: ":1:stac:\dos" means: The
path "\DOS" on the second drive, which driver name starts with "STAC".
.br
And "-:-:hd_c:\\foo\bar" means: the path "\FOO\BAR" on the physical
drive, which volume label starts with "HD_C". 
.cu
Note:
The dash '-'
within the colons ":-:" stands for: "retrieve the physical drive
letter", whereas the dash '-' before the first colon stands for "treat
the following path as a physical one".

.IP "/? and /h"
Display a help screen.
.IP /#
Causes 
.cu
swsubst
to display the statistic about JOIN'ed drives,
when it dumps the CDS table.
It displays the number of JOIN'ed drives according to the CDS and
the number retrieved fromout DOS internal data structures. When these
differ, it's possible, that the system will not work correctly.
.br
If this option is used twice, it cancels the effect of the previous one.
It also cancels the effect of 
.cb
/!
.ct .
.IP /!
This option displays the JOIN'ed drive statistic under the CDS table and
updates the internal number, if both differ.
.br
When this option is given twice, the second is ignored.
.IP /a
After the given command has been processed successfully, the CDS table
should be printed. If the command itself orders to dump the CDS table,
it is displayed only once.
.br
This options also causes to display unused entries.
.br
A second 
.cb
/a
option cancels the effect of the previous one.
.IP /f
There is a little space within the device drivers, where their names can
be stored. Normally the part of the name from the frist available byte
up to the first non-printable charchater forms the name.  If this option
is given, the whole name is displayed, non-printable characters are
displayed in a hexadecimal manner, like \x??, where ?? are the two
hexadecimal numbers for that value.
.br
A second 
.cb
/f
option cancels the effect of the previous one.
.IP /_
Normally only a subset of the 16 available flags are displayed. This
option enables a little map, where the named flags: Networked, Physical,
Joined, Substed, and Hidden are marked with their capital letter, if
they are set; the others will be displayed as a plus '+'. If a flag is
not set, its positions is overwritten by a dash '-'.
.br
A second 
.cb
/_
cancels the effect of the previous one.
.IP /k
Causes 
.cu
swsubst
to create the path if necessary, e.g. when
invoking the command "swsubst /k f: c:\\foo\bar". 
.cu
Note:
This
feature is disabled by default!
.br
This option cancels the effect of a previous 
.cb
/t
and 
.cb
/k
.ct .
.IP /t
Causes 
.cu
swsubst
to test, if the desired paths are available,
if not the command is aborted.
.br
This option cancels the effect of a previous 
.cb
/t
and 
.cb
/k
.ct .
.IP /d
This is not really a options and is for use only with the commands 
.cb
/j
and 
.cb
/u
and acts like a 
.cb
/d
as the second argument.
.br
The second 
.cb
/d
cancels the effect of a previous one.
.IP /o=#
This option is also for the commands 
.cb
/u
and 
.cb
/j
only and
overwrites the fromout the path-argument determined backslash offset.
.cb
Use with caution!
.br
A second option will overwrite a previous one.
.br
The number 
.cb
#
must be within the range 0..66 and can be given in C
notation. That means, if the number starts with either "0x" or "0X", the
rest will be treated hexadecimal, if the number starts with "0", the
rest will be treated octal, and if the number starts with a number from
"1" to "9", it's treated decimal.  When 
.cb
#
is zero, this option is
disabled and the backslash offset is determined fromout the path
argument.
.br
This option is needed to use network paths, which normally do not
conform to the DOS path specifiaction.
.br
.IP /x=??
This option specifies the drives, which are excluded while searching for
the drive of a volume label via the enhanced "::*:" drive specification.
.br
Each Option cancels the effect of a previous one and 
.cb
/x=
excludes
no drive.
.br
This option is very useful to exclude the floppy drives, because
scanning them with no floppy loaded uses an huge amount of time.
.IP /m
This command accepts any number of arguments, which are treated as path
specifications. Those will be created along with the full path to them.
.IP /c
This command accepts exactly one argument. This argument is treated as a
path specification, which is made with the 
.cb
/k
command. If this was
successful, the current working directory and the current disk will be
set to that path.
.IP /j
This acts like 
.cu
JOIN
without the restrictions.
.br
There are two formats:
.br
1) 
.cb
dr
( 
.cb
/d
| 
.cb
-
)
.br
which will release any existing SUBST or JOIN relation of the logical
drive 
.cb
dr
and is equal to "
.cb
.ct dr
-
.cb
.ct dr
.ct :". In this process
.cu
swsubst
tries to determine the settings of this physical drive
while boot time.
.br
2) 
.cb
dr1
[
.cb
.ct -
.ct ]
.cb
.ct dr2
.ct :
.cb
.ct path
.br
which will release any exising SUBST or JOIN relation of the logical
drive 
.cb
dr1
and joins it into the 
.cb
path
of drive 
.cb
dr2
.ct . The
optional dash indicates a physical path. A logical path will be
transformed into a physical by the DOS call 
.cu
truename
.ct . A physical
path is only upper-cased and fully qualified. To omit this, too, a
second dash must be placed in front the optional one. 
.cu
Note:
Drives
starting with two backslashes "\\\\" are treated as networked drives and 
preceed the path with one dash automatically.
.br
When DOS displays a path, it can skip some characters. This is called
.cb
backslash offset
.ct .  Because this backslash offset cannot determined
for networked paths by 
.cu
swsubst
for sure, the 
.cb
/o
is offered
and the offset can be altered manually.
.IP /u
Is equal to 
.cb
/j
.ct , except that the drive is not JOIN'ed, but SUBST'ed.
.IP /q
This command test the drive flags, if they are set according to the
specified flags. The syntax is equal to 
.cb
set drive flags
.ct , except that the
mode '=' and the flags "ON" and "OFF" are not allowed.
.br
.cu
swsubst
returns the result to the calling process via the
errorlevel.  An errorlevel of zero indicates, that the flags are set
equally; an errorlevel greater than zero indicates, that they arn't.
.IP /r
This command accept up to one argument. It enables to display and search in
the device driver chain. The chain is displayed, when the command has no
additional argument, or when the argument is either '+' or '-'.
.br
The output looks like:
.br
NUL     
.br
CON      <<D>> ANSI    
.br
MSCD001  <<D>> SGCDU   
.br
EMMXXXX0 <<D>> EMM386  
.br
CON     
.br
AUX     
.br
PRN     
.br
CLOCK$  
.br
COM1    
.br
LPT1    
.br
LPT2    

.br
The names left of the "<< >>" are the driver names, the character within
the "<< >>" is the MCB type, and the names right of the "<< >>" are the
names of the file. Latter is a favour of the routine, which has been
loaded the driver, so it might be missed. The MCB type itself was
invented with DOS version 4.
.br

The search is activated, when the additional argument is neither '+' nor
'-'. If the first letter is an '+', the names right of the "<< >>" are
searched, too. For matching an leading '+' or '-' is stripped.
.br
The errorlevel is set to zero, if the search was successful, otherwise
to a value greater than zero.
.IP /l
This command accept up to one argument. It enables to display and search
in the MCB (
.cb
.ct M
.ct emory 
.cb
C
.ct ontrol 
.cb
B
.ct lock) chain. The chain is
displayed, when the command has no additional argument, or when the
argument is either '+' or '-'.

The elements have the following meaning, from left to right:
.br
+ The address of the MCB. It's hexadezimal, and always preceeded by
"0x".
.br
+ The type of the MCB. It might be a space.
.br
+ The number of associated paragraphs. It's also always hexadecimal
and preceeded by "0x". This number will be displayed only, if the
argument "+" has been given.
.br
+ A *guess*, what this MCB is for. This can be any combination of the
following items:
.br
++ nam=???. The name of the loaded program, which is read directly out
of this MCB.
.br
++ env=???. The name of the program, which owns this MCB as its environment.
.br
++ drv=???. The name of the driver, which owns this MCB.
.br
++ own=???. The name of the program, which owns this MCB.
.br
++ sys:???. This is memory controlled by the system. "???" stands for
the type of data stored there. A special meaning has "sys:end_of_chain",
what indicates the last MCB in the chain.
.br
The names need not be stored within the MCB; if there should be a name,
these items are substituted by an item of the format: "*#0x????", where
"*" stands for the item type (the first three characters), and "????"
stands for the 4-digit hexadezimal value of the owner's MCB.
.br
The output is designed as input for programs. Therefore the elements
contains no spaces itselfs and each MCB is printed on its own line.
Because 
.cu
swsubst
tries to determine a sub-chain within a MCB, these
sub-chains are indented. But this can lead into false entries. This is
shown at the beginning of the above example (s. 0x041d).
.br
The above example contains two MCBs marked with "sys:end_of_chain".
This behaviour bases on the way later DOS versions manage the memory
by dividing into two chains; one in the conventional memory, the other
in the UMBs.
.br

The search is activated, when the additional argument is neither '+' nor
'-'. The additional name is matched case-insensitive. Unless the first
character is an '+', the name determined fromout the MCBs (which follows
the "nam=" item in the MCB chain display) must only start with the
argument. For matching an leading '+' or '-' is stripped.
.br
The errorlevel is set to zero, if the search was successful, otherwise
to a value greater than zero.
.IP /s
This command requires two arguments. Both are logical drive specifications,
which are simply swapped.
.IP /n
This command is closely related to 
.cb
/s
.ct , but it does not swap the
entries within the CDS, but tries to swap their unit number of the 
device driver. This requires, that both drives share the same 
device driver. That is the only way to swap the floppies, for some
reason.
.br
If there is no argument to this command, it tries to identify both
floppies and swaps them; otherwise two arguments must be specified,
which are to be swapped. 
.cu
Caution:
Better do not use this command
on hard disks.
.br
This swap will not be resetted, neither by the commands 
.cb
-
.ct , 
.cb
--
.ct ,
and 
.cb
/d
nor by directly manipulating the drive flags, e.g. "X:=OFF" or
"X:=ON". Them must be swapped again or the computer must be rebooted.
.IP /w
This command requires one argument, treats it as a drive specification
and translates it into the drive letter. This will returned via the
errorlevel.
.br
An errorlevel between 65 (ASCII 'A') and 90 (ASCII 'Z') indicates OK and
the drive letter itself; whereas a errorlevel of zero indicates, that
there is no such drive; and other errorlevels indicate an error.

.IP "without any command switch"
In that case the arguments decide, what command is invoked:
.IP "without arguments"
This will dump the CDS table onto screen:

.br
H 0000:0000 NET .... PHYS ..... HIDDEN \\H.\A."\BC4
.br

+ physical path. The double quote marks the 
.cu
backslash offset
.ct , all
characters to the left are not visible. If the path points to "A:" or
"B:" and the unit number has been changed, for example by command 
.cb
/n
.ct ,
the string " => X:" is appended, where 'X' stands for the possible drive
letter this path points to.

.br
Line 2:
.br
+ driver name. The "==>..<==" are not part of the name.
.br

the flags does not effect the values.

.br
Line 3:

error.
.br
Unless the
.cb

options is enabled, only used and the last entries are displayed.
.IP "one argument: either - or --"
.cb

will remove all SUBST and JOIN relations by invoking the 
command "/u dr: /d" on all such drives;
.br
.cb
--
does the same but for all not networked drives.
.IP "set drive flags"
This requires exacly one argument in the syntax:
.cb
dr
.ct :{(
.cb
.ct -+=
.ct )
.cb
.ct flag
.ct }, where the mode 
.cb
-
means: unset or
is not set; 
.cb
+
.ct : set or is set; and 
.cb
=
.ct : set this and unset all
other flags.
.br
The following flags are available: 
.cb
OFF
switch the drive OFF, it is
no more accessable; 
.cb
ON
switch a drive ON (This is 
.cu
NOT
the
reversal of OFF, but the invoking of the command "/u dr: /d".);

.IP o
A relative physical path is qualified by logical components.
.IP o
Sometimes the manipulation by the non-standard possibilities fails; then
either the system locks up or a harmless 'Cannot find *.*' error message
beeps up.
.IP o
To turn ON a drive is the opposit of turning it OFF. For local hard disks
this works; for device driver driven drives sometimes; and for CD-ROMs
seldom.
.IP o
Works on MS-DOS compatibles only, but doesn't check, if it is.
.IP o
This program does some error checking, but much could be valid, but locks
the system in several cases.
.IP o
Several commands, like  
.cb
/s
.ct , 
.cb
/u
.ct , and 
.cb
/j
.ct , cancel the
32 bit access and the ability to hold the permanent swap file of Microsoft
Windows 3+ on the used drives.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "swsubst /w ::HD_e:"
Checks, if an hard disk with a label starting with "HD_E" is currently
available via a logical drive letter. The result can be checked with:

.br
swsubst /w ::hd_e:
.br
if errorlevel 91 goto error
.br
if errorlevel 90 echo Drive Z:
.br
if errorlevel 89 echo Drive Y:
.br
...
.br
if errorlevel 65 echo Drive A:
.br
if errorlevel 1 goto error
.br
if not errorlevel 1 echo No volume with label HD_E found!
.br

With 4DOS e.g.:

.br
iff %? .LE. 90 .AND. %? .GE. 65 then
.br
echo Drive %@char[%?]
.br
elseiff errorlevel 1 then
.br
echo error
.br
else
.br
echo There is no volume with label HD_E
.br
endiff
.IP "swsubst /s e ::HD_e:"
Swap the drive currently accessable via the logical drive letter E: and the
drive with the label "HD_E". Doing so can ensure, that the drive "HD_E"
is always accessable via the drive letter E:.
