  README         notes about quirks in MS-DOS executables and compilers
  crc_i86.asm    optimized 8086/80286 assembler version of generic crc32.c
  doscfg.h       OS-dependent configuration, included by unzpriv.h
  msdos.c        OS-dependent UnZip routines for MS-DOS
  makefile.bc    makefile for Borland C++ and Turbo C++
  makefile.msc   makefile for Microsoft C and make or nmake
  makefile.tc    makefile for Turbo C and make
  makefile.wat   makefile for Watcom C
  makefile.dj1   makefile for GNU C, djgpp v1.12m4 port
  makefile.dj2   makefile for GNU C, djgpp v2.x port

Notes:

(1) Two makefiles for djgpp/GNU make are provided, one for djgpp 1.12 and one
    for djgpp v2.x.  In addition, djgpp1 and djgpp2 targets are provided in
    the Unix makefile (unix/Makefile).  Read the appropriate makefile sections
    for details.

(2) The Unix makefile also has an msc_dos target which can be used for MSC 6.0
    or later, but such use is discouraged and the target may disappear in the
    future--use makefile.msc instead.

(3) For DOS emx+gcc use the gccdos target in the OS/2 makefile.os2.  This
    target has only been tested in cross-compilation from OS/2 to MS-DOS,
    but it should work under plain MS-DOS with a proper make utility.  The
    resulting executables require emx.exe or rsx.exe to run (akin to djgpp
    1.x's go32.exe).
