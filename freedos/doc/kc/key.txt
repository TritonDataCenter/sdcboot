The KEY language is a high level language for programming PC keyboards. It
describes a large number of effects that the pressing of keys and key
combinations of a PC keyboard may produce.


DEFINITIONS:

Physical keyboard:
   Each possible variation of an enhanced AT (MFII) keyboard, where by
   variation it is understood the labels physically printed in the keys.

Scancode (breakcode, makecode)
   Each key pressing produces at least one or more scancodes, that is, a byte
   code that can be read from the keyboard controller by a software. 
   The sequence of scancodes is used to univocally determine the key that has
   been pressed.
   There are two types of scancodes, breakcodes and makecodes. A makecode is
   produced when a key is pressed, and a breakcode is produced when the key is
   released. The breakcode and makecode produced by the same key have the lower
   order 7 bits equal, whereas the makecode has the bit 7 clear, and the
   breakcode has this bit set to 1. Thus, makecodes range 1-127, whereas
   breakcodes range 129-255, and the breakcode and makecode for the same key
   differ in 128.
   Most keys produce a single scancode (break or make) upon a key pressing or
   releasing. However, some keys (added in MFII keyboards, respect to the old
   PC style keyboards) send the scancode E0h (224) before the proper breakcode
   or makecode. These keys will be called E0-prefixed.
   Finally, some few keys behave oddly. Exemply gratia, pressing and releasing
   the PAUSE key produces the scancode E1h (225) before a key combination that
   simulates the pressing of Control+NumLock.

Character:
   Pressing a single key may have several effects, being the most usual the
   production of a (character,scancode) pair that is stored in a character
   buffer, that may be queried by upper layer applications. We shall use the
   term character to denote a byte that identifies a character in the
   current codepage table.
   
Command:
   A key may produce a character. For the contrary, pressing a key may as well
   trigger other special effects, such as invoking OS calls, modifying the
   internal status of the software, toggling shifts, which will be
   called COMMANDS of the given software.

Mode:
   A family of assignments of scancodes to 1-byte characters or commands of a
   same physical keyboard, so that a change in mode causes that a single key 
   may be producing two different character patterns in the screen.
   For example, the existence of a Cyrillic and Latin mode on Russian layouts.

Codepage awareness:
   A keyboard driver is a codepage aware device, because upon a change of the
   display device codepage, the codes for the same character pattern may
   change.

Submapping:
   Each of the possibly assignment tables (lookup tables) of scancodes to
   1-byte characters. Different submappings exist because of the existence of
   Modes, and because of the codepage awareness of a keyboard driver. Each
   submapping has an associated codepage number, but it does not need to be
   unique, and two different submappings may well have the same codepage ID,
   for example if they belong to two different modes.
   A submapping is often given as a table, where blank entries mean that the
   submapping does not define a character or command (see below), that we shall
   express as 'not found'.
   This table may usually only cover changes respect to other existing mapping.

Planes:
   For each submapping, the behaviour of a key may be multiplexed by using
   different PLANES, so that the number of characters that may be produced is
   far larger than the number of keys. Planes are differentiated of each other
   depending of the status of activity of certain other modifier keys, which
   status is tracked by the driver and/or BIOS. Typical keys of this type are
   SHIFT or CapsLock.

General and particular submappings:
   There will be a division between one GENERAL SUBMAPPING, and the rest, a
   list or PARTICULAR SUBMAPPINGS, of which only one of them will be active at
   a time. 
   A new scancode/plane triggered by the keyboard controller is checked against
   the active particular submapping first. If the scancode/plane is NOT found,
   then it is checked against the general submapping.
   If it is neither found there, then the keyboard driver functioning may
   prescribe how to deal with that.
   Note that in submapping tables, a particular submapping assignation of a
   scancode/plane pair OVERRIDES the assignation of the general table.

Diacritic sequence:
   To enlarge the number of characters that can be produced even more, some of
   them (often diacritics) may be produced as the result of the pressing of two
   different keys. The first key is said to trigger the start of an accented
   sequence command, and it is often called a Dead Key, because it produces not
   visible character.

string:
   Some drivers may offer the ability to produce a whole array of
   (character,scancode) pairs, instead of a single one. Such array will be
   called a string.



1.- INTRODUCTION TO A KEYBOARD DESCRIPTION


A keyboard description must, roughly speaking, define the effect of the
pressing or releasing one of the keys of the keyboard, where this effect can
be the release of a (scancode,character) pair, or the execution of a
command.

Note however that the effect of that key may be conditioned by several factors:

1) The currently active PLANE (this is, the status of other keys or indicators,
such as the status of CapsLock or the status of the Control key)

2) The presence of unresolved diacritic sequences

3) the currently active submapping (which depends on the codepage being used
and the mode of operation)

As a first approximation, the keyboard description defines the effect of each
possible (PLANE,SCACODE) pair. As the total number of possible planes grows
exponentially with the number of admissible MODIFIER KEYS, and most of those
combinations are after all useless, the description must contain a listing of
the planes that will be effectively used in these combinations (for example, if
the descriptor defines the behaviour of the single pressing of keys, and of the
shift+key and control+key combinations).

The effect of such key pressing will be obtained from a KEY LOOKUP TABLE, where
for every scancode and admissible plane, one can find its effect.

The effect of changing mode (e.g. cyrillic=>latin) or codepage drastically
alters the behaviour of the keyboard, thus different tables will be used for
each SUBMAPPINGs.

Finally, there are a couple of particular behaviours to be also collected in
such description.

(1) Modifier keys (control, shift, capslock,...) are used to define planes, but
do not produce a visible effect on their own.
However, there are some keys that have been traditionally assigned behaviour
modification capabilities, but that have different features from the modifier
keys mentioned above:

   (1a) The effect is produced after the key is pressed and released (unlike
        shift or control)

   (1b) The pressing of that key does not alter any LED in the keyboard
        (unlike CapsLock and NumLock). For this reason, the effect of pressing
        such keys is not visible at all, and have been called DEADKEYS.
        (Although in fact keyboard drivers have been tracking it)

   (1c) The behaviour modification lasts only for the next character being
        pressed, and then vanishes

   (1d) BIOS does not track this effect

These modifier keys are normally used to produce compound characters
(diacritics), thus will be called Diacritic starters (rather than DeadKeys),
where the key itself is labelled as an graphic modiphier (such as '), next
character released is composed (if possible) with this character (for example,
for 'e' becomes the character 'e' with the accented mark ' over it. For most of
the rest, the character can't be composed (is not accepted in the current
character set), and it is said that the sequence is aborted (usually two
characters are produced, the individual initial character before the the second
character that couldn't be composed).

Also the amount of characters that can be composed is relatively small, and
thus this deserves a special treatment by a keyboard descriptor, by giving a
list of possible composable characters.


(2) Sometimes it is desirable that not only a single (scancode,character) pair
is produced, but rather a finte array of such pairs, that will be called
STRING.

As the amount of STRINGS is usually smaller, they will be considered as a
special case, and needing a special consideration.

To sum up, a keyboard description will be formed by a set of different data
segments, called SECTIONS, that will contain informatino of different kinds:

(a) Key look-up tables

(b) Plane descriptors

(c) Submapping descriptors

(d) Diacritic sequences

(e) Strings

So far the amount of information that a keyboard descriptor will contain has
been sketched. It is now convenient to separate the information in two
categories: data sections and logical sections.

DATA SECTIONS have contain information which is codepage dependant, and thus
the section in use must change upon a codepage (most generally submapping)
change. For this reason, more than one of these sections may appear on the
file.

The characters to be produced by a key combination may reside in different
locations in different character sets (codepages), thus key look-up tables are
data sections). The same applies for diacritic sequences and strings.

LOGICAL SECTIONS contain static information which remains valid for the whole
keyboard description. For this reason,  they appear only once (if any) in the
file.

The layout of the different admissible submappings is clearly static, and for
simplicity, the same plane definitions will be used for the whole keyboard
descriptor (thus being static).

A physical keyboard descriptor in KEY lenguage is very closely related to the
Keyboard Control Block (KeybCB), which is a BINARY descriptor of a physical
keyboard. In fact, COMPILERS that binaryze a descriptor in the KEY language
into a KeybCB can be easily designed.

Finally, the data in the descriptor file will be line-oriented. The begining o
 a new section is marked by a section identifier in sware brackets (as for
example [PLANES]). 

The sections may appear in any order. 

A line starting with the character ';' is interpretated as a comment, and will
be ignored.

In fact, each of the sections contains descriptors of different nature, thus we
may consider that there is a "sublanguage" for each of the sections.



2.- TOKENS


Through all the sections there will be the following three tokens: identifiers,
numbers and simple characters.


2.1.- IDENTIFIER

A identifier is a finite sequence of symbols

a-z
A-Z
0-9
_

that will be used to label the data sequences.


2.2.- NUMBERS

By a number we shall mean a sequence of digits 0-9 representing a decimal
number at most sized one byte (that is, 0 to 255) or one word (that is, 0 to
65535).


2.3.- CHARACTER

A character token is used to represent a single-byte character. Although the
notion of character is in theory codepage dependent, we are always actually
more interested in its position in certain codepage. 

Whereas a character is usually represented by its own symbol embedded in the
descriptor (except characters '#' and '!'), at times we would prefer to
introduce the character directly by its position number like this:

  #n

where n is a byte number. The characters '#' and '!' are represented by

  ##

and

  #!

respectively.



3.- THE LOGICAL SECTIONS

There will be three possible logical sections: the GENERAL section, the 
SUBMAPPING section and the PLANES section. The three of them are started with
the name of the logical section between brackets.


3.1.- The [GENERAL] section

The General section is intended as a list of options that may be used to
extend the KEY description by the software using the descriptions. For example,
compilers to KeybCBs may use this section to add compiling specific options.
The recommended format is

<OptionName>=<OptionValue>

although other forms may be admitted if they are unambiguously defined (e.g.
they do not start with the '[' character).

The KEY language only defines a single option (that must be unique), which
syntax is

DecimalChar=<character>

that defines the character that should be used by Shift+WhiteDel (or WhiteDel
with NumLock active), provided that this key/combination is not remaped.

Example:

[General]
DecimalChar=,

Replaces the usual decimal char with the , character


3.2.- The [PLANES] section

This section is used to describe how to identify the planes that will be used
in ALL the look-up tables present in the descriptor.

The following are PLANE keywords:


Family Left key    Right key    Both keys
=========================================
1      LShift      RShift       Shift
       LAlt        AltGr        Alt
       LCtrl       RCtrl        Ctrl
------------------------------------------
2      ScrollLock
       NumLock
       CapsLock
       KanaLock
------------------------------------------
3      E0
------------------------------------------
4      UserKey#   (# = 1..16)
------------------------------------------

A descriptor may define 2 or more planes, where the two first planes are
mandatory and implicitely defined, and the rest of them are defined in the
[PLANES] section.

Every line in the [PLANES] section is a plane descriptor, and consists of two
groups of zero or more plane keywords, separated by a vertical bar (|). The
keywords before the bar are those modifier keys that must be ACTIVE, and those
after the bar are modifier keys that must be INACTIVE, for the plane conditions
to be satisfied. If no keywords are defined after the vertical bar, it can be
omitted.

Respect to the meaning of 'ACTIVE', for the first family of keywords, ACTIVE
means pressed, for the second and fourth it means ON, and for the third, it means
that E0 prefix has been sent by the keyboard driver.

BIOS does not track the UserKeys of family 4, as this is something left to the
software using the descriptor. The change of status of such keys can be
introduced using commands.

The first of the two implicit planes is the NO-KEY plane, which is intended for
when no modifier is active. Exceptionally, if the keywords NumLock, CapsLock or
ScrollLock are not used to define ANY plane in the [PLANES] section, then the
status of the key NumLock, CapsLock or ScrollLock, respectively, is ignored
when determining if this plane is active.

The second of the two implicit planes is exactly equal, except that it requires
that any of the Shift keys has been pressed, and will be called the shift plane.

Plane computation is sequential from the first two implicit planes, and then
through the planes in the [PLANES] section downwards. This means that if we
defined

[PLANES]
Alt
Ctrl

then the combination Ctrl+Alt+Key is considered to belong to the third plane
("Alt"), because the single condition "Alt is pressed" is fullfilled. To make
it belong to the fourth plane, encode it like

[PLANES]
Alt | Ctrl
Ctrl

Example:

[PLANES]
AltGr | Ctrl
Ctrl  | Alt
Alt

Defines 5 planes: the no_key and the shift implicit planes, a plane active when
AltGr (or AltGr+Alt) is pressed, a fourth one when either Control (but no Alt)
is pressed, and a last one when either alt is pressed.


3.3.- The [SUBMAPPINGS] section

The submappings section defines the different submappings admitted by the
descriptor.

The general format is

    <codepage>  <keytable_name>  <diacrit_name>   <stringtab_name>

where
   codepage       codepage (a word number)in which the submapping works
                  0  means that the submapping can work well under ANY codepage

   keytable_name  identifier of a table look-up data section to be used, or '-'
                  '-'  means if no table look-up is used

   diacritic_name identifier of a diacritic data section to be used, or '-'
                  '-'  means if no diacritic sequences are used

   stringtab_name identifier of a string data section to be used, or '-'
                  '-'  means if no strings are used

trailing '-'s can be removed.

Among the different submappings defined, the first one is called the GENERAL
submapping, whereas the rest will be called PARTICULAR submappings.
Only one of the particular submappings will be called the ACTIVE submapping.
Which one is active at every moment depends on the software using the
descriptors.

The behaviour respect to the different submappings should be as follows:

(1) When a character is pressed, and the current plane is computed, the table
look-up table for the ACTIVE submapping is queried. If no character is found
there, then the look-up table for the GENERAL submapping is queried.

(2) When a Diacritic sequence or String is started, it is sought in the ACTIVE
submapping first. If the active submapping does not define diacritic sequences
at all, then those of the GENERAL are sought.

Note that the behaviour is different so that, if the ACTIVE submapping defines
strings, then the GENERAL submapping will never be checked, even if the
requested string number was not found in the list of strings of the active
submapping.


Example:

[SUBMAPPINGS]
0    table1
437  table1   diac1
437  table2   diac1
850  table3   diac2  strings1


4.- THE DATA SECTIONS

AS we mentioned above, there are three types of data sections: table look-ups,
diacritic sequences and strings. Any data section header must also include an
identifier that labels the section, separated by : from the section name.

Identifiers must be unique across data sections. Two data sections of different
kind may neither share an identifier.

4.1.- TABLE LOOK-UP

A table look-up must define a way to determine the effect of pressing or
releasing certain key being certain plane active. The section is started with

[KEYS:<keytable_name>]

The effect of such key pressing can be either a character to be released, or
certain special effect to happen, which will be called a COMMAND for the
keyboard driver. Such commands will be defined by

      !number

where number is a byte number.

Thus, we will define a TABLE_CHARACTER as either a character token (as defined
above) or a command.

Finally, we can consider the case in which a change of scancode is desired as
well. In order to do this, we define a TABLE_PAIR as a expression with the
syntax

      number/table_character

where number is the new scancode, and the second component is the desired
table_character.

At this point we can introduce the table look-up as a set of lines leaded by a
scancode, and which defines the effect of that scancode for the different
planes. More precisely, the format is given by

 [R]number[flags]  t1  [t2] ...

where the number is the scancode number. The optional R distinguishes the
makecode (when absent) from the breakcode (when present). The admissible
flags are

  Flag   Meaning
  ======================================================================
  C      The key is affected by the CapsLock status, and planes 1 and 2
         are automatically swapped if CapsLock is ON
  N      The key is affected by the NumLock status, and planes 1 and 2
         are automatically swapped if NumLock is ON
  X      THe key must be locked and have no effect at all. t1, t2, ...
         will be ignored and may be omitted
  S      Determines wether the effect of pressing the key is given by
         table_pairs (when present), so that scancodes may be modified,
         or by table_characters, which scancode will be the same number
         that leads the line
  ======================================================================

If a scancode is not specified, then it is considered not present in the table.

Any number of effects t1, t2, ... may be specified, whereas if for a plane the
effect is not present, then the scancode/plane pair is considered not present
(undefined) by the table. However, if the flags C or N are used, then at least
TWO of those effects t1 and t2 are mandatory.


Example:

All the look-up tables for all submappins of the Spanish layout should contain
a line like this:

  39C  ñ   Ñ

that identifies the key with scancode 39 as the key that produces the 'Ñ'
letter (and that is also affected by the CapsLock status).


4.2.- DIACRITIC SECTION

A diacritic section defines a set of diacritic pairs. It starts with

[DIACRITICS:<diacrit_name>]

The section describes the pairs of diacritics ordered by the ortographic sign.
It is customary that certain scancode/plane pair is devoted to start the
diacritic sequence, and the software using this descriptor may prescript the
ussage of certain commands (see section 4.1) to start one of such diacritic
sequences.

The format of each line is

o  P1 [P2] ...

Where o is the single ortographic sign, and Pi are pairs of character tokens
(not separated by blanks, but one after the other) that represent the letter
before and after being affected by the diacritic.


4.3.- STRINGS SECTION

A string section declares a list of strings (in different lines) that may be
output by the software upon certain scancode/plane pair, usually started by
COMMANDS (see section 4.1). The section must start with

[STRINGS:<stringtab_name>]

A string is a finite sequence of STRING PAIRS, as for every pair one must 
define both the scancode and character to be used.

The most direct way to write a pair is

\K{S,C}

where S and C are, respectively, the scancode and character. We also have the
pairs:

\S{s}   equivalent to \K{s,0}
\C{c}   equivalent to \k{0,c}

A single character different from '\' of order n in the codepage table is
identified with \C{n}. In other words, ASCII messages (not including \) can be
introduced as strings, where the scancode output will always be 0 for all of
them.

The character '\' must be introduced like

\\

And finally, there are a set of other predefined symbols that introduce the
scancode/character pair that simulates the pressing of a key. Namely, we have

\n         For the carriage return
\[key]     where key is one of

              HOME      END      PGUP     PGDN      INS
              UP        DOWN     LEFT     RIGHT     DEL

              Fx        CFx      AFx      SFx

In the last group, x is a number 1-12, and they represent the function keys,
possibly modified by other key. Thus

\[F2]    stands for the key F2
\[CF2]   stands for the combination control+F2
\[AF2]   stands for the combination alt+F2
\[SF2]   stands for the combination shift+F2

Example:

This is a example of \nmessage in two lines
