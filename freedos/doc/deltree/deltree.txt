DELTREE.COM is a freeware clone of Microsoft's DELTREE.EXE, a utility for
quickly deleting files and subdirectories.  This is a dangerous program --
it can delete many things very quickly!  USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I will
not be responsible for any loss of data or damage to hardware, whether
caused by program error, programmer error, user error, or act of God.

DELTREE.COM is meant to be freely distributed, for the benefit of DOS users
everywhere.  See the section "Distribution" below for the legalities.


                               --------------
                               GENERAL SYNTAX
                               --------------

DELTREE [/Y] [/V] [/D] [/X] filespec [filespec...]

  /Y    Delete specified items without prompting
  /V    Report counts and totals when finished
  /D    Display debug info
  /X    For testing; don't actually delete anything

Options may be uppercase or lowercase, and may begin with a slash or a minus
sign.  There must be at least one filespec, and there may be more than one.
Note that any options must be specified at the start of the command line,
before any filespecs.  This syntax is different from many DOS utilities, but
compatible with Microsoft's DELTREE.EXE.

Filespecs may name files, directories, or DR DOS-type list files.  You may
use wildcards; all matching files and directories will be targeted.

Files will be deleted regardless of their attributes.  Directories will be
deleted with all their contents.

A "file list" is a text file containing filespecs, one per line.  If you have
a list of items to be deleted in a file VICTIM.TXT, type DELTREE @VICTIM.TXT
(Note that the @-sign is not part of the filename, just a flag to indicate a
file list.)

Unless /Y is specified, DELTREE will prompt you before deleting each item
specified on the command line.  Press Y to delete the item indicated, N to
let it live, or Q to quit DELTREE immediately.  /Y prevents the prompt --
use this option with caution!

If /V is specified, DELTREE will report the total number of files deleted and
subdirectories removed when it finishes.  If any files were deleted, the
total of the files' sizes will also be reported in bytes and in kilobytes or
megabytes.  The fractional part of the kilobytes or megabytes may be off by
plus-or-minus one in the least significant digit.  The total size does not
take cluster size into account; the amount of disk space freed may be greater
than the size reported.

                             ERRORLEVEL RETURNS
                             ------------------

               00   Success
               01   Something could not be deleted
               03   User abort (Q, control-C)
               16   General syntax error, or buffer overflow
               17   Not enough memory
               18   DOS 3.0 or better required
               19   Problem with list file
               20   Internal buffer overflow
               21   Error resolving directory name (dots_fix)

               INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH MICROSOFT'S DELTREE.EXE
               ----------------------------------------------

This section contains technical trivia.  Most users can ignore it.

These are the known differences between Microsoft's DELTREE.EXE (I'll just
call it MS's) and my own DELTREE.COM (which I'll call "mine") :

Mine will offer an additional safety prompt if items in the root directory of
a non-removable drive are to be deleted and /Y was specified.  This is a
deliberate incompatibility with Microsoft's utility.  There is no option to
disable this check; you must reassemble the program if you wish to remove it.
See the customization section below.

MS's DELTREE, as far as I can tell, does no error checking at all!  According
to HELP, DELTREE returns Errorlevel 0 for success -- and there are no other
return codes.  Even if you do totally foolish things like DELTREE CLOCK$ or
trying to remove the current directory, MS's utility reports success.  Mine
will check for failures, and print an error message if something doesn't
work.  Mine also returns different documented Errorlevel codes.

MS's will sometimes call a directory a file.  Specifically, this happens when
you delete a directory with any attributes set.  MS's utility will still
delete the directory correctly, but this bug may confuse users.  The error
appears to have been fixed in the Win95 version of DELTREE, and I don't
emulate it in mine.

MS's does not deal gracefully with I/O redirection when /Y is not specified.
Redirecting STDOUT makes the prompts invisible, and redirecting STDIN keeps
them from working altogether.  Mine disallows I/O redirection if /Y is not
specified (maps STDIN and STDOUT back to the console for user interaction.)

Mine accepts DR DOS-style file lists.  MS's does not.  If you want to delete
a file or directory beginning with an at-sign, enclose the name in quotes:
DELTREE "@ODDNAME"  -- this syntax is legal for both MS's and mine.

MS's will try to delete character devices, and happily assume success.  Mine
will ignore device names.

MS's may display relative filenames (like "foo" or "..\subdir")  Mine will
always display absolute filenames ("c:\bin\a86\foo" or "a:\subdir")

MS's allows you to enclose options in quotes (huh?)  So DELTREE "-Y" FOO
will delete FOO without prompting.  Mine interprets anything inside quotes as
a filename, so DELTREE "-Y" FOO will prompt you before deleting -Y and FOO.

MS's does not support /V /D or /X.

Mine is smaller, and has a different filename (.COM versus .EXE)  If you keep
both utilities in the same directory, typing the command DELTREE (with no
extension) will start my DELTREE instead of Microsoft's.

MS's supports long filenames under Windows.  Mine does not.

If you're writing a batch file that needs to be compatible with MS-DOS
DELTREE, check the following:  Don't use file lists, /V /D or /X.  Don't
rely on Errorlevel.  Don't redirect output unless you specify /Y.  Don't
ever redirect input.

                                CUSTOMIZATION
                                -------------

The source file DELTREE.S contains a few definitions to make it easier to
remove certain options or behaviors.  Comment these out (i.e. place a
semicolon at the start of the line before the respective %define) and
reassemble with the command NASM DELTREE.S -O DELTREE.COM

-- Removing this --           -- Does this --
%define Enable_Sw_Y           changes /Y to a do-nothing option
%define Enable_Sw_V           removes the /V option and postmortem display
%define Enable_Sw_D           removes the /D option, debug code and strings
%define MungaBunga            removes the root-directory safety check
%define SwitchesOnlyAtStart   permits options after filespecs

This program was originally created using Eric Isaacson's shareware assembler
A86.

Current versions are assembled using the Netwide Assembler, available from
http://nasm.sourceforge.net/

I compress the binaries in the distribution using UPX.  Visit
http://upx.sourceforge.net/

Tom Dalton suggested including a "defanged" version (DELTREE2.COM) in the
archive.


                                -----------
                                WHAT'S NEW?
                                -----------

1.02f   2005-04-06    Removed now inappropriate "old FreeDOS kernel" support.

1.02e   2003-06-22    3,234 bytes                              8C41A645  4593

Added a compile-time option to permit options to appear anywhere on the
command line.  (The default behavior still mimics Microsoft's.)  Tweaks to
the syntax text; the requirement for options to come before filespecs is
more clearly explained (unless this requirement has been removed.)  All
options are explicitly listed in the syntax text, including the formerly
neglected /X.  All dates are now in ISO format.
