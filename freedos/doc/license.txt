This is a simple little program that users can use to 
easily get the version of the distribution installed,
and if wanted the version of the specific program
that CAME WITH the distribution this program is 
distributed with.  This program is updated with each
release, and simply displays hard coded information.
Only covers boot and base.

It is written and maintained by Kenneth J. Davis
The source & resulting executable are placed into public domain (no copyright).
The source is provided only as a reference, as this program has little
use other than obtaining information about a specific distribution.
